Vim-Qiuy Mappings: Activity Alter
=================================

A collection of mappings connected with inserting, removing and
altering content within Vim.

A major bulk of the mappings make use of chord sequences, combinations
of keys pressed at the same time in order to generate commands and/or
responses.

== Benefits of Chord Structure
====
The justification of this is to ensure that:
  * Users are able to express complex requests in a single act
  * Commands are framed logically, improving muscle memory
  * The requirement for moving fingers across the keyboard is reduced
as a consequence of more emphasis on keys in the middle of the
keyboard
* Chord structure enables unifying of commands around task rather than
  plugins - novelty of chords mean that the whole 'leader key' dilemma
is sidestepped
Installation

Full instructions coming soon.

Until then a recommendation would be to investigate Vim-Plug
