Vim-Qiuy Mappings: Activity Alter
=================================

A collection of mappings connected with inserting, removing and
altering content within Vim.

A major bulk of the mappings make use of chord sequences, combinations
of keys pressed at the same time in order to generate commands and/or
responses.

Coming soon.

Until then the comments in the contained files should be sufficient


Benefits of Chord Structures
===========================
Chord structures seem greatly unused, partly because most people learn
computing from a GUI environment. People usually spend so much time learning
the processes and habits around mouse based navigation and information system
interaction that using keyboards for more than providing text input and
navigating between programs and within them via tab movement. However, many
tasks which you perform can be broken down into easy to recall acts to
streamline your workflow and improve your productivity.

Chords have productive benefits over sequential chord sequences:

    * Tools which use sequential key commands crowd eachother out, resulting in
      inelegent combinations. As a result many useful tools get trapped in the
      'spare keys' untouched by previous developpers.

    * Many sequential command mappings involve a lot of dancing around,
      resulting in fingers and wrists having to stay constantly active. This is
      usually as a result of programmers either trying to use memory clues
      (such as ci" to change inside double bracketS) or because its rare to be
      able to have available sequence keys next to one another.

    * 'Power keys', such as ctrl, mod/super, alt or a leader key provide some
      respite from these problems, as better combinations are available as
      a result of more keys being thrown up. However, they have drawbacks
      physically, as being at the edge of the keyboards means that their use
      can ctrl your qwertyparty. Additionally, their familiarity with hotkeys
      but the lack of standardisation can cause conflicts between window
      manager/terminal/GUI/program environments. Chasing letters while holding
      down the alt key in order to navigate menus is not worth the gubbins when
      compared with alternatives.

    * Creating acts triggered by characters ordered in a coherent fashion
      results in fingers staying in the maintyping areas for longer and
      commands being called in a terse and more composed structure.

    * A considered structure for chords makes learning muscle memory for tasks
      easier, as complimentary/similar areas. Expressions can be built up
      logically similar to how menus are built. Imagine that each finger is
      a menu category - just as you can reach the desired item with 4-6 menu
      stages, so too can you express something using 4-6 fingers striking at
      the same time (with the advantage of probably being more precise given
      permutation possibilities)

    * An effective chord structure encourages the unifying of commands around
      a coherent task structure and not the plugin.  Such an approach allows
      for upgrading or replacing tools (or degrading an area of a tools
          functionality) in a more joined up manner, as this would envolve
          changing what the tasks chord sequence leads to rather, without the
          need for adjusting muscle memory in order to perform the similar
          actions.

    * Think of chord keys as discovering a new land, which offers greater
      customisation and (potentially) more orderly approach - like Columbus
      landing in America and being met by IPV6.
