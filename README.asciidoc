Vim-Qiuy Mappings: Activity Alter
=================================
A collection of mappings connected with inserting, removing and
altering content within Vim.

A major bulk of the mappings make use of chord sequences, combinations
of keys pressed at the same time in order to generate commands and/or
responses. The justification of this is to ensure that:
* Users are able to express complex requests in a single act
* Commands are framed logically, improving muscle memory
* The requirement for moving fingers across the keyboard is reduced as
  a consequence of more emphasis on keys in the middle of the keyboard
* Chord structure enables unifying of commands around task rather than
  plugins - novelty of chords mean that the whole 'leader key' dilemma
sidestepped
